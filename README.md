waxon
=====

waxon is a Google Apps-based platform for practicing wax-on-wax-off exercises -- that is, questions that could be really boring but you often need to do a lot of them before you can solve them without effort. (Another term would be 'volume training'.)

waxon is a plugin based system in two ways:

* Each question type is provided as a separate plugin. This should allow adding more questions easily.
* You practice the questions within 'frames', which as also provided as plugins. One frame could be 'I want to practice a selected exercise type infinitely', while another frame could be 'A test with 4 exercises from these 10 question types'.

You can try out an early version of the script here:
